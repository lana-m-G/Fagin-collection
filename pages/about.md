This past fall semester, I took part in an introductory digital humanities course at New College of Florida.
At this college is home to the Fagin Room in the Jane Bancroft Cook Library, dedicated to Holocaust survivor and educator Helen Fagin. While there is a physical place to preserve her personal archive, none of it has been digitized. In honor of Helen and her work, I have begun to digitize some of her personal collection as part of a final project. While it is still a small sampling of newspaper clippings 
and letters, I hope to continue working on it in the future. -	Lana
